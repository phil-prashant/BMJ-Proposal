print("""
1. ‚ùå BASE PACKAGE RADIO BUTTONS ARE HIDDEN
   - opacity: 0 makes them invisible
   - Users can't see selection status
   - Text overlaps with hidden radio button
   
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è  ADD-ON CHECKBOXES - NEEDS BETTER PADDING
   - Checkbox too close to text
   - Mobile: text wraps and overlaps checkbox area
   - Gap between checkbox and label needs increase
   
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è  TERMS CHECKBOX - SIMILAR ISSUES
   - Long label text wraps awkwardly
   - Insufficient horizontal padding
   - Mobile responsiveness poor
   
4. ‚úÖ PAYMENT TERM RADIO BUTTONS - MOSTLY OK
   - Good layout but needs mobile touch-friendly sizing
