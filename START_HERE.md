- Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
- Choose **`phil-prashant/BMJ-Proposal`**
- Click **"Deploy Now"**

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables
In the Railway dashboard, go to **Variables** tab and add:

```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_73miNRj6_83vuf1KSmVNeiAwBM1U37jtN
EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_kkb35zr
EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_dbqjamx
EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=lWcX2ZAuSeQUVvyNk
```

### Step 4: Generate Domain
- Go to **Settings** → **Networking**
- Click **"Generate Domain"**
- Copy your Railway URL (e.g., `https://bmj-proposal.up.railway.app`)

### Step 5: Wait for Deployment
- Check **Deployments** tab
- Wait for green **"Success"** status
- View logs if needed

### Step 6: Test Your Deployment
Open in browser:
```
https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-25T11:00:00.000000",
  "service": "BMJ-Machinery Email Server"

## ⚙️ Configuration Details

### Port Configuration
- **Application Port:** 5000
- **Railway Port:** Automatically assigned via `$PORT` environment variable
- **Procfile Command:** `gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT`

The app automatically:
1. Uses Railway's `$PORT` in production
2. Falls back to port 5000 for local development
3. Runs with gunicorn (production-grade server)

### Environment Variables (Set in Railway Dashboard)

| Variable | Value | Required |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | `re_73miNRj6_83vuf1KSmVNeiAwBM1U37jtN` | ✅ Yes |
| `EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID` | `service_kkb35zr` | ✅ Yes |
| `EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID` | `template_dbqjamx` | ✅ Yes |
| `EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY` | `lWcX2ZAuSeQUVvyNk` | ✅ Yes |
| `FLASK_DEBUG` | `false` (default, secure) | ❌ Optional |
| `PORT` | Automatically set by Railway | ❌ Auto |

## 🔒 Security Features

✅ **Debug Mode Disabled** - Production runs with `debug=False` (secure)
✅ **Environment Variables** - Sensitive data not in code
✅ **CodeQL Verified** - 0 security alerts
✅ **Production Server** - Uses gunicorn instead of Flask dev server
✅ **Health Checks** - Railway monitors app health automatically

## 🔄 Automatic Redeployment

Railway automatically redeploys when you:
- Push code changes to GitHub (main/production branch)
- Update environment variables
- Manually trigger redeploy from dashboard

---

## 🎯 API Endpoints

### 1. Health Check
```
GET /health
```
Returns: Server health status

### 2. Send Proposal Email
```
POST /api/send-email
Content-Type: application/json
```
Sends custom marketing proposal to recipient

### 3. Test Email (Development)
```
POST /api/test-email
```
Sends test email to verify configuration

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check **Build Logs** in Railway dashboard
- Verify `requirements.txt` is correct
- Ensure Python 3.9+ compatibility

### App Crashes
- Check **Deploy Logs** for errors
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Review application logs

### Health Check Fails
- Ensure app binds to `0.0.0.0:$PORT`
- Check `/health` endpoint exists
- Review startup logs

### Emails Not Sending
- Verify `RESEND_API_KEY` is correct
- Check EmailJS credentials
- Review application logs for API errors
